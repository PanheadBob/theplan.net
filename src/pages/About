      <p className="mb-4">
        Plan B for Men was created as a practical and emotional support system
        for men going through the most disruptive moments of their lives —
        divorce, separation, or significant relationship transitions.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Our mission is to offer not just guidance, but action — through
        short-term live-in support, strategic planning, therapy referrals, and
        lifestyle restructuring. We help you recover, reset, and reclaim your
        future.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn’t about looking back. It’s about building what’s next —
        stronger, smarter, and with a Plan B that works.
